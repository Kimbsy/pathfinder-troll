# How to troll a GM for fun and profit

## TL;DR
I believe it is possible to set up an in-game business offering NPCs a messaging service with end to end encryption.

## Preface

A little while ago while playing pathfinder, a sequence of events occurred in-game which gave me an idea.

It was the first time running a game for our GM, so occasionally the rules were a little scrappy, and every now and then they let us do something which _perhaps_ a more experienced GM would've avoided.

We were given two things which I believe allows us to do some really interesting things.

>Disclaimer: Our GM is great and we are having a lot of fun in our game, this is just a thought exercise to see how far we can break the rules we were given.

## The two things

##### 1. Early game doggos
In one of our first few sessions the party was attacked by dogs, pretty standard stuff. However, myself and another player decided that we wanted to capture the dogs, and keep them as pets.

We managed to engage the dogs in a grapple and somehow kept succeeding on our grapple checks for the rest of the fight and then continually while doing other things for the rest of the session. Eventually the GM, bored by our persistence, decided we could keep the dogs as pets.

##### 2. Magical sausages
A little while later we were fighting some giant bats in a crypt, I landed a dual wielding double crit and sliced a bat into a thousand tiny pieces. The GM decided that as a reward for mincing the bat we could turn it into a sausage (the GM named it 'batwurst') which they assured us would surely have interesting magical properties.

As it turns out, a batwurst sausage, when put in a cast iron pan for 10 minutes, duplicates and turns into two batwurst. In order to balance this, batwurst go rancid after two days (apparently they smell worse than anything) and so each individual sausage has a limited life span.

## Hypothesis

With pet dogs and magical doubling sausages I believe it is possible to set up an in-game business which offers NPCs a secure messaging service with end to end encryption utilising Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

## Doubling

## Mersenne primes

## Key exchange

## Dog tricks

## Implementing division

## Implementing modulo
