# How to troll a GM for fun and profit

## Preface

A little while ago while playing pathfinder, a sequence of events occurred in-game which suddenly gave me an idea.

It was the first time running a game for our GM, so occasionally the rules were a little scrappy, and every now and then they let us do something which _perhaps_ a more experienced GM would've avoided.

## The two mistakes

##### 1. Don't give players pets.
In one of our first few sessions the party was attacked by dogs, pretty standard stuff. However, myself and another player decided that we wanted to capture the dogs, and keep them as pets. We managed to engage the dogs in a grapple and somehow kept succeeding on our grapple checks for the rest of the fight and then continually while doing other things for the rest of the session. Eventually the GM, bored by our persistence, decided we could keep the dogs as pets.

##### 2. Don't invent funny magical items.
(unless you're happy for them to be abused).
A little while later we were fighting some giant bats in a crypt. I landed a dual weilding double crit and sliced a bat into a thousand tiny peices. The GM decided that as a reward for mincing the bat we could turn it into a sausage (he named it 'batwurst') which he assured us would surely have interesting magical properties.
As it turned out, this sausage, when put in a cast iron pan for 10 minutes, would duplicate and turn into two sausages.
